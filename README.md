# Game Description

The Amputation Man is a word-guessing game inspired on the classic Hangman where players try to figure out a hidden word by selecting letters.
With each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman figure disappears, starting from the legs and ending with the head.
The player wins by correctly guessing all the letters before the hangman is fully removed. Hints are provided to assist the player, and the game can be restarted after a game over or the end.
